- Communication Service verification complete - comprehensive implementation of equipment and motion control endpoints with proper error handling and WebSocket support
- Process Service verification complete:
  1. Standardized on "create" terminology instead of "generate"
  2. Added missing DELETE endpoints for parameters and patterns
  3. Added missing PUT and GET endpoints for patterns
  4. Added WebSocket endpoint documentation
  5. Updated API documentation to match implementation
  6. Restored nozzle/powder management endpoints for configuration management
- Data Collection Service verification complete:
