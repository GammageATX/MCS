# MCS Project Meeting Notes

## 2024-01-03: Project Structure Setup
### Participants
- Development Team
- AI Assistant (Cursor)

### Decisions
1. Adopted monorepo structure for better code organization
2. Selected key technologies:
   - Frontend: React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui
   - Backend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy
   - Package Managers: pnpm (frontend) + uv (backend)

### Action Items
- [x] Set up monorepo structure
- [x] Configure shared types
- [x] Create project documentation
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline

### Technical Decisions
1. Type Safety
   - Using shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend
   - Strict type checking enabled
   - Pydantic models in backend to match TypeScript types

2. Development Workflow
   - Feature-based directory structure
   - Comprehensive documentation requirements
   - Test-driven development approach

3. Package Management
   - Using uv for Python dependencies (faster, more reliable)
   - Using pnpm for Node.js dependencies (efficient, deterministic)

### Next Steps
1. Complete development environment setup
2. Begin user authentication system implementation
3. Set up initial database schema

## Notes for Future Meetings
- Review CI/CD requirements
- Discuss testing strategy
- Plan first sprint goals
